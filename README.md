# FriendKeeper
FriendKeeper is a fullstack chrome extension built by Dylan Thorwaldson that allows users to receive customized desktop notifications to help build and maintain friendships.

Have you ever forgotten a friends birthday or anniversary? Or thought of a friend you haven’t heard from in a while and wish you would stay in touch more consistently? FriendKeeper can help! Let's take a look at how:

Firstly, click on our handy chrome extension browser button to launch FriendKeeper's web application!

Now that you're on the landing page, you can see your list of current friendships FriendKeeper is helping you maintain. Let's add a friend!

![addfriend](https://github.com/DTThor/FriendKeeper/blob/master/readme_screencaps/addfriend_form.png "addfriend")

Users input their friends information like name, birthday, anniversary, and how often the user would like to contact that friend via 3 different mediums: Email, Phone, and Text.

Once the user submits data for a friend, chrome will send a friendly reminder to the user’s desktop when it’s time to reach out to the given friend on whatever medium the user provides. This is MVP.

If anything changes, or a user wants to reach out to his/her friends more (or less) often, users have the ability to edit each friend's information, or delete them entirely (sad face).

When it's time to reach out to a friend, FriendKeeper will send this friendly reminder based on the users input type and duration!

## Challenges
FriendKeeper is the very first chrome extension I've built, so the newness of the technology brought it's own host of challenges. Beyond that, however, a main challenge that I faced was actually getting the chrome notifications to not only send, but to send at the correct time. Investigating what documentation is current/applicable for Chrome apps/extensions proved to be a challenge, especially considering the fact that Chrome apps will be deprecated soon, and that the apps and extensions documentation is very similar. I overcame this challenge by actually using a notification system that is browser agnostic, so as not to rely on Chrome's notification API.
